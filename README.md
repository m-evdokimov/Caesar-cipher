The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest method of encryption technique. It’s simply a type of substitution cipher, i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. Function cipher takes one argument: 1 - to encrypt string, -1 - to decrypt. User inputs string (ONLY lowercase english alphabet + space) with shift and then function prints the cipher.


The Ceaser Cipher is written on Python 3. Start main.py. 

```python
	cipher(1)  # ‘i am caesar’, 3 -> ‘lcdpcfdhvdu’
	cipher(-1) # ‘lcdpcfdhvdu’, 3 -> ‘i am caesar’
```
